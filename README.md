Key measures of socioeconomic indicators are essential for making informed policy decisions, but due to the high costs and operational difficulties
of traditional data collection efforts, obtaining reliable socioeconomic data remains a challenge, particularly in developing countries. 
This work presents a deep learning methodology to estimate socioeconomic indicators using satellite imagery. 
The neural network model developed was trained at the Brazilian region of São Paulo and Paraná with the goal of analyzing the 
socioeconomic indicator of income in the Vale do Ribeira region.  The model yielded a R-squared of 0.4016 and performed significantly better than the model 
trained only on RGB bands.
